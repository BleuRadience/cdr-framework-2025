--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INVESTMENT THESIS

Market Size: $1.2 trillion carbon removal market by 2050 (McKinsey)
Our Position: Multi-revenue CDR platform reducing carbon price dependency
Target IRR: 18-25% with carbon credits at $50/tonne

THE OPPORTUNITY

Total CDR Potential: 85.6 GtCO₂ by 2050
Peak Annual Rate: 6.2 GtCO₂/year
Cumulative Profit (2025-2050): $4123.4B
Break-Even: 2025

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES

• Multi-revenue model reduces carbon price dependency
• Scalable on degraded land (no food competition)
• Mycelium binding creates durable carbon storage
• Rapid deployment timeline (5-7 years to GtCO2 scale)
• Policy-aligned with Farm Bill, IRA, EU Green Deal

REVENUE MODEL (Per Tonne CO₂ Removed)

Carbon Credits:     $50  (compliance + voluntary markets)
Hemp Materials:     $35  (building products, textiles, bioplastics)
Ecosystem Services: $15  (biodiversity, soil carbon, water quality)
────────────────────────
Total Revenue:     $100  per tonne CO₂
Total Cost:        $45   per tonne CO₂
