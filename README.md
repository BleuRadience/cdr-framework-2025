# Gigatonne-Scale Carbon Removal Framework
## Mycelium-Hemp Composites for Profitable Climate Mitigation

**Author:** (Cassandra D. Harrison), AvaBleu Design LLC  
**Status:** Commercial-ready framework available for licensing  
**Impact:** 85.6 GtCO₂ removal potential (2026-2050)

### Overview

This repository contains a complete technical and commercial framework for 
achieving profitable carbon dioxide removal (CDR) at gigatonne scale through 
mycelium-hemp composite systems.

**Evolution:** Started as academic model → refined into commercial asset with 
honest cost analysis and realistic profitability pathways.

### Key Findings

**Current Economics (Baseline):**
- Cost: $223/tCO₂
- Revenue: $100/tCO₂  
- Status: Unprofitable (-$123/tCO₂)

**Transformed Economics (5-year timeline):**
- Cost: $118/tCO₂ (through breeding + automation + mycelium optimization)
- Revenue: $240/tCO₂ (IRA 45Q + advanced materials + premium carbon markets)
- Status: **Profitable (+$122/tCO₂, 50% margin)**

### Repository Contents

- **Commercial Framework:** Complete economic modeling with policy integration
- **MRV Protocol:** Verification standards (Verra VCS, Gold Standard, IRA 45Q)
- **Profitability Roadmap:** 7 specific technical interventions to achieve viability
- **Business Documents:** Partnership deck, policy brief, execution plan
- **Data & Visualizations:** Investor-grade charts and detailed projections

### Use Cases

**For Licensing:** Contact bleuisresting@gmail..com for commercial licensing terms  
**For Policy:** `POLICY_BRIEF.txt` ready for congressional staffers  
**For Research:** Full methodology with peer-reviewed citations  
**For Investment:** Complete due diligence package in `/03_business_documents`

### Technical Approach

1. **Genetic Improvement:** Breed 2x higher-yielding hemp cultivars (3-5 years)
2. **Mycelium Optimization:** Engineer enhanced soil carbon strains (2-4 years)
3. **Precision Agriculture:** Deploy automation for 60% labor reduction (1-3 years)
4. **Advanced Materials:** Develop mycelium-hemp building products (+$40/tCO₂)
5. **IRA 45Q Access:** Navigate EPA approval for $130/tCO₂ tax credits (1-3 years)
6. **Premium Markets:** Target Stripe, Microsoft for high-quality carbon credits
7. **Ecosystem Services:** Monetize biodiversity, water, soil co-benefits

### Success Metrics

- **Year 1:** 5-6 tCO₂/ha sequestration (vs. 3.5 baseline)
- **Year 3:** 7+ tCO₂/ha + commercial materials production
- **Year 5:** Break-even or profitable operations at commercial scale

### Investment Required

**Total:** $5-10M over 5 years  
**Sources:** USDA grants (60%), climate VCs (30%), revenue (10%)  
**Probability:** 40-60% success with competent execution

### Citations & Standards

All calculations reference:
- IPCC 2019 Guidelines (land use carbon accounting)
- USDA NRCS soil carbon protocols
- Verra VCS methodologies (VM0042)
- IRA Section 45Q regulations
